# Stance Taking in Santa Barbara Speech
## Summary
Using the [Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English](https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/research/santa-barbara-corpus#access), I want to investigate conduct a discourse analysis on stance taking between interlocutors. The corpus is predominantly contains face-to-face conversations involving spontaneous speech, which is ideal for a study on stance taking. 

## Data
The corpus contains 60 recordings and transcriptions, totaling in about 249,000 words. A title and brief summary are provided for each one, giving important context regarding the content of the conversation. Since I am interested in spontaneous speech and natural (or as natural as possible) conversation, only 45 of the 60 transcriptions will be usable.

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8T,9T,10,11,_,13,14T,15,16T,17,18T,19,_,_,22T,23,24T,_,_,_,_,29,_,31,32,33,34,35,36,37T,_,_,_,_,42,43,44,45,_,47,48,49,50,51,_,_,_,_,56,57T,58,59,60

I found this corpus on two different websites: [UCSB](https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/research/santa-barbara-corpus) and [TalkBank](https://sla.talkbank.org/TBB/ca/SBCSAE). Both contain orthographic transcriptions of the same speech, but use different notations and conventions. After reviewing both, I am choosing to use the former. 

Given the non-word speech symbols used, there will be a decent amount of cleaning that will have to occur. Depending on my exact research question, I will have to decide which symbols to filter out and which to keep, along with time stamps and speaker names. 

## Analysis
When I took Discourse Analysis a couple years ago, we learned about stance taking and applied it to our own transcriptions that we had produced. I would love to expand on that on a larger scale using a corpus.

I haven't quite figured out exactly what aspect of stance taking I will investigate, but I am most interested in the following topics, which come from Scott Kiesling's LING 1800 Spring '22 class notes under the header "Kiesling's crazy stance theory (2022)":

* Modes of investment: lexical intensification/hedging
* Modes of alignment: metrical (poetic) or exchange (turn-taking)

The former would involve identifying specific words within the transcripts, while the latter would look more at the structure of the transcription itself. The way I process the data will depend on which topic I choose to investigate, but I don't want to choose until I do futher research into each.
