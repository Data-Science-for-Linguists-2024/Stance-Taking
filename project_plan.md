# Stance Taking in Santa Barbara Speech
## Summary
Using the [Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English](https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/research/santa-barbara-corpus) (SBCSAE), I will conduct a discourse analysis on stance taking between interlocutors. Specifically, I will focus on varying lexical items in order to investigate investment. The SBCSAE contains a variety of different types of speech, but I will only be using the transcripts of face-to-face conversations involving spontaneous speech.

## Data
The corpus contains 60 recordings and transcriptions, totaling in about 249,000 words. Since I am interested in spontaneous speech and natural (or as natural as possible) conversation, only 43 of the 60 transcriptions will be usable.

The UCSB webiste provides a title and brief summary for each recording, giving important context regarding the content of the conversation. The transcripts themselves contain times stamps that correspond to the recordings, as well as a variety of different non-alphanumeric characters that indicate other aspects of the speech. Those will be cleaned out when I process the data. 

## Analysis
In his paper "Stance and Stancetaking" from 2022, Scott Kiesling discusses theories of stance and quantitative approaches to the topic. His theory has 3 dimensions: evaluation, alignment, and investment, though for the present study I am most interested in **investment**. 

Investment can be understood through categories like epistemicity and evidentiality, but Kiesling explains that it can also be "embedded in the meanings of lexical items and contructions" as well as in "hedges and boosters" (Kiesling p. 420). For example, *I mean* is used to increase investment, while *just sayin'* is meant to decrease investement. Another example given is the difference between the uses of like vs love, and dislike vs hate, showing how the choice reflects the speakers current investment in the topic. 

Reading about these varying degrees of investment that can be indicated lexically has inspired the topic of my study: I want to choose a few coomon words that have more/less extreme counterparts and gauge their uses in the SBCSAE (similar to like-love). I can then look at the environments in which the words are found and conduct an analysis on the level of investment each word indicates.

In terms of adding value to the data, I plan to annotate the transcripts based on investment (and potentially other aspects of stancetaking too). 

## Plan of Action
These are the main tasks that I will need to complete (not necessarily in this order)
- Annotate transcripts
- Process data (filtering out the non-alphanumeric characters)
- Choose and find target words
- Investigate word environments
- Conduct the analysis and draw conclusions
