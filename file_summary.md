# Summary of the transcripts used
Only 43 of the 60 SBCSAE transcripts are used in this analysis because the other 17 are not examples of spontaneous speech. Below are the descriptions of the conversations included in the [`data_samples`](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2024/Stance-Taking-in-Spontaneous-Speech/tree/main/data_samples) folder, retrieved from the [SBCSAE page](https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/research/santa-barbara-corpus). They are a combination of conversations and task-related talk, but all of them are face-to-face interactions.
